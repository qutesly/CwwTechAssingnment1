        <br>
        <br>
        <p>My name is Sylvester-Pius Orekie, I'm 27 years old, a native of Anambra state, a student of UNIZIK, CEP, department of Science Education, 200level. I come from a family of 4 and I'm the 2nd child. I do not have a favorite meal but I prefer proteinous food to carbonhydrate. I'm not a very social person but I like to make new friends and observe how they think and behave, I listen more than I talk sometimes and learn as much as possible no matter how little. I like the color grey more than a few other colors. I'm just a simple an average person trying to learn a skill to maneauver through life and have a chance at creating a better life for myself. </p>
